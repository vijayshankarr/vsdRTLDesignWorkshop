# RTL Design using Verilog with SKY130 Technology

#Introduction to RTL Design and Synthesis
##Open source simulator - iverilog

Simulator checks if the Design is matching the specs. Here, Design means a set of Verilog files which perform a functionality. 
Note : Simulator only works when there is a change in input.
The Testbench where the Design is to be tested and the Design are given as input to iVerilog. This gives us a `.vcd` file. `vcd` stands for Value Change Dump format. This contains the change in inputs and the outputs. This vcd is passed to `gtkwave` tool using which we view the waveform.

iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v --> creates a.out file.
Runinng /a.out --> dumps the vcd file
open the .vcd file using gtkwave tool.
